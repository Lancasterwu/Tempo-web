### Motivation

This website is build for people who is interested in understanding me deeper after reading my resume/linkedin/other meterials. I didn't plan to have a personal website before I hear about this course, since I knew that graduate school admission office and HR of companies do not look at applicants' personal website that much. However, after I read "Why Every Job Seeker Should Have a Personal Website", I changed my mind since this article introduced that it is easy to make one and having one is better than have nothing. With this perspective, I want to design my website that can truely show my understanding and opinions on several things such as education, computer science, economics, which is not included in my resume or linkedin.

### Step by step

Since I have web development background. I decided to build this website from scrach and not using other people's template. The difficulty of using the existing template is that: First, it is usually difficult to customize. People usually are allowed to change, images, texts, colors, but they are limited from changing the whole structure of the website due to that some of those code are difficult to understand. For my situation, since I wan to show my creativity on this website design, it is better for me to design it from scrach. Second, since I made this website for people who wants to know me more, it is a good opportunity of showing my webdevelopment skills. People who is good at web development can specify the frame you choose, so I feel using react can show that I have industry-level web development skills.

The information architecture assignment helped me a lot on designing my website structure and planning the contents. Since my website is hace a lot of painting work to do, I made the basic structure of the website by using react bootstrap components, then focused on painting the packground pictures. After I finished all background pictures, I then filled in contexts.

### TODO

Although this website is a MVP, it is also an incompleted website that I am going to keep develop. The next step is to fix the font size and color for the projects section and then provide links to my code projects over there. Since I was using boostrap carousel component for that section, it is difficult for me to change the font style within the carousel javascript component. However, I can modify the scss code to change the style of that component. After that, I need to add the side bar similar to a nav bar so people can click and go to the section they want to go. I have to design the buttom UI and the bar frame UI, which will take a while. The next todo is to update the background images. I only had limited time of drawing them, some of them should be improved such that carousel section suppose to have 5 different images instead of one. The next step is to modify the scss ro allow the website to support different devices. I thought boostrap would provide that, but in react it is just a component which htm
